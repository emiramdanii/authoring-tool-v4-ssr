Task ID: 7.2A-Patch
Agent: Super Z (main)
Task: Sprint 7.2A-Patch — Fix 7 P0 Issues from Senior Review

Work Log:
- P0-1 Fix: saveSucceeded() with null savingRevision is now a no-op (returns false, does NOT mark clean)
  - Eliminates double-lifecycle bug where stale saveSucceeded could incorrectly mark project clean
  - Replaced saveProjectToDBInternal() with persistProjectToDB() pure primitive (no lifecycle calls)
  - Only executeDurableSave() owns the save lifecycle: startSaving → dbSaveFn → saveSucceeded/saveFailed
- P0-2 Fix: persistProjectToDB() throws on error (does not swallow/catch)
  - Previously saveProjectToDBInternal() caught errors and called saveFailed() but didn't rethrow
  - Now coordinator's catch block handles all error state properly
- P0-3 Fix: Removed all rate-limit/throttle from durable-save path
  - Removed DB_SAVE_MIN_INTERVAL (2s) from save-utils.ts coordinator
  - Removed lastSaveRef (1s) throttle from use-project-manager.tsx
  - Debounce on autosave is sufficient; skipping saves and marking clean was data loss
- P0-4 Fix: Save-before-switch now BLOCKS the switch if save fails
  - Added flushDurableSave() that waits for in-flight save before starting new one
  - loadProject() returns early with error toast if flushDurableSave returns false
  - Previously: "warn the user but still allow the switch" → now: "jangan muat B"
- P0-5 Fix: SaveNowButton, AutoSaveIndicator retry, and CommandPalette use legal hook calls
  - Replaced dynamic import + useProjectManager() in callbacks with top-level hook calls
  - SaveNowButton: useProjectManager() at component top level
  - AutoSaveIndicator: useProjectManager() at component top level for retry handler
  - CommandPalette: useProjectManager() at component top level + ref for action callbacks
  - Fallback localStorage message is now honest: "Cadangan lokal tersimpan, tetapi database belum diperbarui."
- P0-6 Fix: Hydration depth counter replaces boolean
  - _hydrating: boolean → _hydrationDepth: number (0-based, +1/-1)
  - resetOnLoad() does NOT touch _hydrationDepth (hydration lifecycle managed exclusively by pairs)
  - Fixed ordering: resetOnLoad() first, then startHydration() (so depth > 0 during set())
  - Nested hydration (ProjectManager + CanvaStore.loadFromDB) now safe
- P0-7 Fix: setCurrentProjectId() action for createProject without resetting revision
  - createProject() calls setCurrentProjectId(project.id) instead of resetOnLoad()
  - Preserves dirty/editRevision state so initial content gets saved
  - executeDurableSave() with { force: true } for initial project save
- Rewrote test suite: 36 tests covering all 9 mandatory test categories
  - All 36 tests pass + 24 Sprint 7.1 regression tests pass = 60 total
  - Zero new TypeScript errors in modified files

Stage Summary:
- 7 files changed: dirty-store.ts, save-utils.ts, use-project-manager.tsx, persistence-slice.ts, StatusToast.tsx, CommandPalette.tsx, dirty-coverage-sprint7.2.test.ts
- All 7 P0 fixes implemented and tested
- 60/60 tests passing (24 Sprint 7.1 + 36 Sprint 7.2A-Patch)
- Key new exports: setCurrentProjectId(), flushDurableSave(), persistProjectToDB()
- Key removed: saveProjectToDBInternal() (replaced by pure primitive), DB_SAVE_MIN_INTERVAL throttle, lastSaveRef throttle

Work Log:
- Created notifyMutation() helper in save-utils.ts for SSR-safe markDirty() calls
- Added notifyMutation() to all ~55 Canva Store mutations that were missing markDirty():
  - schema-crud-slice.ts: deleteBlock, moveBlockUp, moveBlockDown, duplicateBlock, addSchemaBlock, addSchemaBlockToContainer
  - schema-ops-slice.ts: pasteSchemaBlock, nudgeSchemaBlocks, deleteSchemaBlocks, reorderSchemaBlocks, alignSchemaBlocks, distributeSchemaBlocks, batchSetVariant, batchDuplicateBlocks, batchMoveBlocks, batchToggleCompression
  - page-ops-slice.ts: moveBlockToPage, splitPageAtBlock, _performMergeUnchecked, moveBlockToContainer, rebalanceCurrentPage, promoteSceneSplit, mergeWithAdjacentPage, splitMateriContent
  - page-slice.ts: addPage, addTemplatePage, duplicatePage, deletePage, setPageLabel, setTemplateType, setVariant, reorderPage
  - background-slice.ts: setBgColor, setBgImage, setOverlay, extractAndSetPalette, setPaletteMapping, updateNavConfig, updateScreenBackground, setSchemaThemeId, updateTemplateData
  - element-slice.ts: addElement, addKuisElement, addGameElement, addModuleElement, deleteSelectedElements, updateElement, deleteElement, moveElementZ, toggleElementVisibility, pasteElements
  - tab-slice.ts: addSceneTab, removeSceneTab, renameSceneTab, setSceneTabIcon, assignBlockToTab, removeBlockFromTab, autoClusterTabs
  - viewport-slice.ts: setRatio, applyLayoutPreset, clearStage, nudgeSelected, alignSelected, distributeSelected

  - schema-preset-slice.ts: loadSchemaPreset, loadCustomSchema, loadGoldenPreset
- Fixed saveProjectToDBInternal to integrate with dirty store state machine (startSaving + saveSucceeded/saveFailed)
- Fixed saveSucceeded() to properly handle savingRevision === null case (direct save path)
- Fixed CommandPalette "Simpan Sekarang" to route through saveProject() for durable save
- Fixed SaveNowButton to route through saveProject() for durable save
- Added save-before-switch logic in loadProject() (saves current project if dirty before switching)

Task ID: 7.1
Agent: Super Z (main)
Task: Sprint 7.1 — Durable Save State Machine

Work Log:
- Audited all persistence/save call sites: markClean, markDirty, saveProject, autosave, save status indicator
- Identified 3 critical P0 bugs: markClean before save completes, no revision tracking, no single-flight guard
- Enhanced dirty-store.ts with revision-based state machine (SaveStatus: idle/dirty/saving/saved/error)
- Implemented editRevision/lastSavedRevision/savingRevision tracking
- Fixed use-auto-save.ts: removed markClean before DB save, added single-flight guard, stale completion rejection
- Fixed save-utils.ts: saveAllToStorage() no longer calls markClean()
- Fixed system-slice.ts: saveToStorage() no longer sets dirty:false
- Fixed authoring/index.ts: Bridge only syncs dirty→true (no markClean propagation)
- Fixed persistence-slice.ts: saveToStorage() no longer sets _saveStatus='saved', load paths call resetOnLoad()
- Fixed preset-slice.ts: applyPreset/newProject now mark dirty (not clean)
- Fixed Riwayat.tsx: History restore uses resetOnLoad()
- Fixed use-project-manager.tsx: Reset dirty on load, don't touch dirty on error
- Updated StatusBar.tsx + StatusToast.tsx: Read from saveStatus state machine
- beforeunload unchanged (already only warns, no forced DB save)
- Wrote 24 tests covering all 8 mandatory test cases
- Build passes, all new tests pass, no regressions in existing tests

Stage Summary:
- 12 files changed, 810 insertions, 143 deletions
- Commit: b86105b
- All 8 PASS criteria met:
  1. No markClean before save success ✅
  2. Save failure preserves dirty state ✅
  3. Edit during save not lost ✅
  4. Stale save completion ignored ✅
  5. Only latest revision can become "saved" ✅
  6. Guru sees honest save status ✅
  7. Recovery snapshot preserved on failure ✅
  8. Build and tests pass ✅

Task ID: 1
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Sprint 7.2A-Patch-3 — Transactional project hydration

Work Log:
- Read current loadFromDB implementation in persistence-slice.ts — found resetOnLoad() and authoring setState called BEFORE parsing
- Identified 3 P0 issues: (1) state mutation before parse validation, (2) null pages returns true, (3) authoring parse failure swallowed
- Rewrote loadFromDB as 3-phase transaction: Phase 1 (validate) → Phase 2 (pure parse) → Phase 3 (hydrate & commit)
- Removed resetOnLoad() from loadFromDB — Project Manager now calls it only after success
- Added pages array validation — null/undefined/non-array throws, returns false
- Added authoringData parse in Phase 2 — if parse fails, entire load aborted before any mutation
- Changed require('@/store/dirty-store') to ESM import (no circular dependency exists)
- Updated use-project-manager.tsx: removed authoring parsing from loadProject (now in loadFromDB), moved resetOnLoad(id) to after loadFromDB succeeds
- Updated CanvaState type: loadFromDB returns boolean
- Created 13 integration tests in hydration-transactional-sprint7.2a-patch3.test.ts that exercise real loadFromDB
- All 74 tests pass (36 dirty-coverage + 25 persistence-boundary + 13 hydration-transactional)
- No new TypeScript errors introduced (2 pre-existing errors in migrateAllSchemas return type)
- Commit 9999631 pushed to origin/main

Stage Summary:
- Commit chain: b56380c → f163e9d → d580391 → 9999631
- P0-1 FIXED: loadFromDB transactional — no store mutation on parse failure
- P0-2 FIXED: pages:null/undefined fails closed, returns false
- P0-3 FIXED: authoringData parse failure aborts entire load
- 13 real integration tests covering malformed data, null pages, authoring contamination, hydration depth, cross-project preservation
- Contract & Boundary ready for FREEZE pending Senior Review

Task ID: 2
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Sprint 7.2A-Patch-4 — authoring isolation, honest save, no outer hydration

Work Log:
- Read all files from Patch-3 (persistence-slice, use-project-manager, save-utils, tests)
- P0-1: Changed authoring commit to use proper defaults (DEFAULT_CP etc.) instead of store.cp fallback
  - When authoringData is null: reset all non-schema fields to DEFAULT_CP/ATP/PETUNJUK/PENUTUP/SUARA
  - When authoringData is partial: missing fields get defaults, never current store values
  - Imported DEFAULT_* from @/store/authoring/initial-state
- P0-2: Removed outer startHydration/endHydration from loadProject
  - Previously wrapped the entire fetch+load in hydration, suppressing markDirty during network wait
  - Now only loadFromDB's internal hydration is active during commit phase
  - Removed finally block that called endHydration
- P0-3a: executeDurableSave now returns fullyClean (result of saveSucceeded())
  - Previously always returned true, causing flushDurableSave to report success when still dirty
- P0-3b: flushDurableSave loops until clean or fail (max 5 attempts)
  - Each iteration: check dirty → save if needed → recheck
  - Breaks on: clean, error, max attempts, project change
- P0-3c: loadProject rechecks dirty after fetch, before committing Project B
  - Second flushDurableSave if user edited Project A during the fetch
- Updated test file: mock DEFAULT_* values, fix authoring data structure (objects not arrays)
- Added 4 regression tests: authoringData=null, partial authoringData, edit-during-save, no outer hydration
- All 79 tests pass (36 + 25 + 18)
- No new TypeScript errors
- Commit d226fc0 pushed to origin/main

Stage Summary:
- Commit chain: b56380c → f163e9d → d580391 → 9999631 → d226fc0
- P0-1 FIXED: Authoring isolation — no Project A fallback
- P0-2 FIXED: No outer hydration during network fetch
- P0-3a FIXED: executeDurableSave returns fullyClean
- P0-3b FIXED: flushDurableSave loops until clean
- P0-3c FIXED: loadProject rechecks dirty before switch
- 4 regression tests added
